  s.description  = <<-DESC
  `OperationsKit` is a collection of `Operation` subclasses which offer a
  promise-based interface to chain results, built on top of `PromiseKit`.

  Its main focus is to offer an easy to use, promise-based approach to work
  with heavy operations, giving users additional methods to spawn children
  operations without deadlocking the system and tracking operation's progress.

  Main features are:

  - `Operation` subclasses for `PromiseKit`-based asynchronous operation.
  - Ready-to-use retryable operation for those situation when a recoverable
  error may arise.
  - Subclasses to wrap blocks returning promises in `Operation`s.
  - Convenience method to wait for children operations without blocking parent's
  queue.
  - Built-in progress to track asynchronous operation status.
  - Extensive code coverage.
